# Final_project_GM

# Goal
Create most accurate product demand forecasting model to optimize inventory level aiming to reduce stockouts and holding costs 

# Step 1 : Data observation and cleaning
Found and handle missing data, zeros , non-proper data types. Negative data were in brackets which was challenging in terms of data type transformation.Negative values in Order_Demand column were removed, most of them with their possitive pairs (probably returns from customers)

# Step 2: EDA

# Brainstorm 
Divide into "predictible" and "non predictible" products / categories. Filter/exclude non-predictible ones.
Find reasons for non-predictibility
Which are most returned products? Which are warehouses with most returns?
